Implemented all four read-only MCP tools for task 112.

**Approach:** Followed the existing `list` tool pattern from task 111. Each tool gets its own file with an input struct, registration function, and handler. Tests use the same in-memory transport pattern from `list_test.go`.

**Completed:**
- [x] `get` tool — wraps scanner to find task by ID, includes body, dependency graph (depends_on, blocks, children)
- [x] `next` tool — wraps `next.Recommend()` with limit, filters, quick_wins, critical params
- [x] `search` tool — wraps `search.Search()` for full-text search with snippets
- [x] `context` tool — wraps `taskcontext.Resolve()` with scopes, project_root, resolve, include_content, max_files params
- [x] All tools registered in `server.go`
- [x] 37 tests total (all passing) — covers happy path, error cases, input validation, discoverability
