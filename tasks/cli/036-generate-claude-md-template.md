# Generate CLAUDE.md Template for Taskmd Users

## Objective

Create a CLAUDE.md template file that users can place in their task directory to help Claude understand the taskmd specification and use the CLI effectively when working with their tasks.

## Context

Users who work with Claude Code in their taskmd repositories would benefit from a standardized CLAUDE.md file that:
- Explains the taskmd file format and conventions
- Documents common taskmd CLI commands and usage patterns
- Provides guidance on task management workflows
- Helps Claude maintain consistency with the taskmd specification

This should be minimal but practical—focusing on the most essential information Claude needs to work effectively with taskmd files.

## Tasks

- [ ] Create `docs/templates/CLAUDE.md` template file
- [ ] Include taskmd file format essentials:
  - Frontmatter schema (id, title, status, priority, etc.)
  - Status values (pending, in-progress, blocked, completed)
  - Priority levels (low, medium, high, critical)
  - Dependencies format
- [ ] Document essential CLI commands:
  - `taskmd list` - List and filter tasks
  - `taskmd validate` - Validate task files
  - `taskmd graph` - Visualize dependencies
  - `taskmd next` - Find next available task
  - `taskmd stats` - Show project statistics
- [ ] Include task workflow guidance:
  - How to update task status
  - How to check dependencies before starting
  - When to use validation
- [ ] Keep it concise (aim for ~100-150 lines)
- [ ] Use clear, actionable language
- [ ] Add to README with instructions for users

## Acceptance Criteria

- CLAUDE.md template exists in `docs/templates/`
- Covers essential taskmd format specification
- Documents key CLI commands with examples
- Provides task workflow best practices
- Concise and scannable (not overwhelming)
- README updated with instructions to copy template
- Template is ready for users to copy into their task directories
