# Do Task

Look up a task and start working on it.

## Instructions

The user's query is in `$ARGUMENTS` (a task ID like `077` or a task name/keyword).

1. **Look up the task**: Run `taskmd get $ARGUMENTS` to find the task
   - If not found, run `taskmd list` to show available tasks and ask the user which one they meant
2. **Read the task file** with the `Read` tool to get the full description, subtasks, and acceptance criteria
3. **Mark the task as in-progress**: Run `taskmd set --task-id <ID> --status in-progress`
4. **Start a worklog entry** (if worklogs are enabled):
   - Check `.taskmd.yaml` for `worklogs: false` -- if set, skip worklog steps
   - Otherwise, find or create the worklog file at `tasks/<group>/.worklogs/<ID>.md` (or `tasks/.worklogs/<ID>.md` for root tasks)
   - Append a timestamped entry noting your approach and initial findings
5. **Do the task**: Follow the task description and complete the work described
   - Use `EnterPlanMode` for non-trivial implementation tasks
   - Check off subtasks (`- [x]`) in the task file as you complete them
   - Append worklog entries when you make key decisions, hit blockers, or complete significant subtasks
6. **Write a final worklog entry** summarizing what was done, decisions made, and any open items
7. **Mark the task as completed** when done: Run `taskmd set --task-id <ID> --status completed --verify`
   - The `--verify` flag will run any verification checks defined in the task before applying the status change
   - If verification fails, fix the issues and try again

## Worklog Format

Each worklog entry uses a timestamp heading followed by free-form notes:

Started implementation of the search feature.

**Approach:** Using full-text search with the existing SQLite database
rather than adding Elasticsearch -- simpler and sufficient for our scale.

**Completed:**
- [x] Added search query parser
- [x] Created search index

**Next:** Add result ranking and write tests.
```
